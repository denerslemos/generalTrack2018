# generalTrack2018

This folder has macros to compare generalTracks quantities for 2018 data with 2015 data and Hydjet MC.

[Here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HITracking2018PbPb/Nov9_generalTracksFirstLook.pdf) you can find slides with results generated with this macros for run 326389.

I created four macros to plot the track quantities. Each macro plot three variables.

## How to use

In your `$CMSSW_BASE/src`, run it using:

`python run.py`

I include some test with run 326722.
